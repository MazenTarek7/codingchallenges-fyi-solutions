# Coding Challenges Solutions

This repository contains my implementations of various coding challenges from [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro).

The goal of these challenges is to build practical tools and systems from scratch, gaining a deeper understanding of how they work under the hood.

## Challenges Completed

- [wc Tool](./wc-tool) - WIP

## Structure

Each challenge is contained in its own directory with the following structure:

```
challenge-name/
│
├── README.md    # Challenge description and my notes
├── src/         # Source code
└── tests/       # Test cases
```

## Running the Code

Each challenge directory contains specific instructions for building and running the solution.

## Goals

My objectives for working through these challenges:

- Deepen my understanding of fundamental tools and systems
- Practice implementing specifications from scratch
- Strengthen testing and documentation skills
- Build a portfolio of practical coding examples
